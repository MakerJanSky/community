- Recommended parameter changes from Responsible Facilitators will be executed, including changes to the [Dai Savings Rate (DSR)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-dai-savings-rate), [Liquidation Ratios (`mat`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-liquidation-ratio), [Stability Fees](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-stability-fee), and [Debt Ceilings](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/vault-risk/param-debt-ceiling) as described below.

- DssCron HouseKeeping will be performed to update the Chainlog with all used DssCron addresses, as detailed below.

**Voting for this executive proposal will place your MKR in support of the changes and additions outlined above.**

Unless otherwise noted, the changes and additions listed above are subject to the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay). This means that if this executive proposal passes, the changes and additions listed above will only become active in the Maker Protocol after the GSM Pause Delay has expired. The GSM Pause Delay is currently set to **48 hours**.

This executive proposal includes an office-hours modifier that means that it **can only be executed between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday**.
