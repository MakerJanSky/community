# Poll: Potential Aligned Delegate Privacy Breach - July 31, 2023

The Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 31 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following statements:
* Based on the evidence submitted by Ecosystem Diane and other available sources, Aligned Delegate Clive is in breach of [Section 2.6.6: Aligned Delegate Privacy](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) of the Atlas.
* AD Clive should be derecognized from his position, and stripped of his Alignment Conserver status. 

For his defense, Clive has posted this [thread]($discussion_link) asserting Diane is mistaken in her assumptions.

Please review these materials, including the further discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Clive will be derecognized, removing him from the list of Aligned Delegates and the potential compensation for that position.
* Clive will be stripped of his Alignment Conserver status.
* Diane will be awarded one-half of the [AD Buffer](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-4-ad-buffer) as bounty for information leading to Clive's derecognition. 

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
