# Second Forum Response - Spork Protocol Changes

Author: JanSky (Governance Scope Facilitator)

Date: Thursday 20th July 2023


Hello Maker Community,

Thank you, Alice, for your proposal to enhance the Spork protocol, and Faraz for your insightful input. I've reviewed the proposed changes and the discussions, and I'm ready to move forward with the governance process.

Given the complexity and significance of the changes, I recommend splitting the proposed changes into two separate polls to ensure clarity and focused decision-making. The proposal will be split as follows:

Poll 1: Adjust Spork Protocol D3M Parameters
This poll will allow the community to express support or opposition to adjusting the DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) parameters as proposed by Alice. The changes include increasing the [D3M Debt Ceiling](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit#debt-ceiling-line), the [Target Available Debt](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap), and the [Debt Ceiling Increase Cooldown](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#ceiling-increase-cooldown-ttl). Please review the [forum thread](Insert link to forum thread) and the provided previous [ABC token analysis](Insert link to documentation) for more details.

Poll 2: Onboard ABC Token to Spork Protocol
This poll will focus on the proposal to onboard the ABC token to the Spork protocol, following the parameters outlined. Please refer to the previous ABC token risk evaluation provided by [risk-provider](Insert link to risk evaluation) for more information.

I believe this approach will allow us to make well-informed decisions and foster active participation within the Maker community. Please keep an eye out for the polls in the voting system on Monday, July 24, and consider engaging in this thread with questions and concerns.

Let's work together to ensure a thriving Maker ecosystem.

Best regards,
JanSky
