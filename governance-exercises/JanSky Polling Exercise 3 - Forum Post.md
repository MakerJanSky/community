Thank you, Emilia, for presenting this proposal to the MakerDAO community.  I'd like to propose a more comprehensive approach to ensure that the community can make well-informed decisions that align with the Atlas and maintain the stability of the ecosystem.

I've reviewed the details provided in the forum thread, and I see a few areas that require careful consideration before proceeding with a poll:

**Voter Understanding**: The proposed standing order change involves substantial adjustments to the revenue transfer mechanism from RWA vaults. To fully comprehend the potential impacts and outcomes, MKR voters need a comprehensive understanding of the proposed changes. While Section 5 of the Atlas and MIP104 offer some insights, it's crucial to ensure clarity on how these changes fit within the existing framework. More details on your final proposed parameters and how they interact with the previous agreement are needed.

**Adherence to Atlas and MIP104**: Both the Atlas and [MIP104](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104) play a role in the governance of RWA arrangements. To enhance the legitimacy of the proposed standing order change, we should aim for alignment with these documents. It is unclear if these changes will result in MagicRWA being classified in a different tier of ALM. I think @Faraz and his team could offer some more detailed insight into this interaction that would be helpful for the community.

**ALM Framework and Structure**: Given the stated need for an update to the ALM framework, it would make sense that we wait for this new structure to be rolled out before attempting to circumvent the structure that exists today in the Alignment Artifacts.


### My Recommendation

Complete Analysis: Have willing Responsible Facilitators work with MagicRWA to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed standing order change. This analysis should consider the alignment with the Atlas, potential impacts, and implications to inform the community.

ALM Framework Update: Await the update to the ALM framework mentioned by Emilia. This update should provide additional administrative clarity and further context to the proposed changes.

ALM Structure Post: Await the ALM structure post and analysis by Faraz and his team. This will contribute to a more informed decision-making process.

Once these steps are taken, we can proceed with a weekly poll that reflects the collective understanding and consensus of the MakerDAO community.

Thank you for your understanding, please keep in mind that in situations where immediate action is required, [MIP24: Emergency Response](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24) can provide a framework for Responsible Facilitators to address urgent matters. If my delay in polling causes an Urgent or Emergency situation to arise, this could be a remedy that would bypass the standard Governance cycles.
