@Diane I understand your concerns and questions regarding the situation with Clive. It's important to approach matters like this with respect and a commitment to the principles of the MakerDAO community.

Regarding your question about the bounty process, it's important to note that any decision on potential actions, including bounties, will be contingent on the outcome of the poll. I will initiate the poll on Monday to address the issue and will respect the collective decision of MKR holders.

The poll text has been drafted with consideration for the Atlas's provisions and the situation at hand. The specifics of the bounty process, as outlined in Article 2.6.6, are contingent upon MKR holders agreeing with the poll and the subsequent decision.

That [article in the Atlas reads](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) "Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful information for determining that the privacy of an AD was compromised" and I intend to follow it if the poll is approved by MKR voters.

I appreciate your understanding and further patience in this matter.
