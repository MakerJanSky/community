# Poll: Deploy Emergency Fix A in imminent executive -  August 9, 2023

The Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Community. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for **12 hours** beginning on Wednesday, August 9 at 18:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following emergency response:
* Deploy Fix A which "prevents the high-severity exploit immediately upon the executive vote passing" and "is likely to incur losses to MKR holders of approximately 20 million DAI over two weeks."

Note that Fix B will "closes the high-severity exploit approximately two weeks after the executive vote passes" at "no risk of incurring financial loss to MKR holders" and could be deployed independently from Fix A.

Due to the potential for a griefing attack, we cannot disclose more information on the nature of the bug discovered. Fix A is the recommended course of action by the team deploying the executive spell, but given the high cost and an alternative recommendation, we request urgent guidance from MKR voters.

Please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Fix A will be included in an imminent Executive Vote.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken without a recommendation from the Protocol Scope Facilitator at this time.**
