# Poll: Adjust Spork Protocol D3M Parameters - July 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitator has placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spork Protocol Ecosystem Actor Alice. The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to adjusting the Spork Protocol DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) parameters. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to express support or opposition to making the following parameter changes to the Spork Protocol DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M):
* Increase of the Spork [D3M Debt Ceiling (`line`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dai-direct-deposit#debt-ceiling-line) from 50 million DAI to 100 million DAI.
* Increase of the Spork [Target Available Debt (`gap`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#target-available-debt-gap) from 5 million DAI to 10 million DAI.
* Increase of the Spork D3M [Debt Ceiling Increase Cooldown (`ttl`)](https://manual.makerdao.com/module-index/module-dciam#ceiling-increase-cooldown-ttl) from 28,800 seconds (480 minutes) to 86,400 seconds (1440 minutes).

Please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* These parameter changes will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
