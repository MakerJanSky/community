# JanSky Polling Exercise 1 Summary 

## Scenario A: Adjusting Spork Protocol D3M Parameters

### Actions Taken:
1. Reviewed the proposal from Alice to adjust the Spork Protocol D3M parameters, including increasing the debt ceiling, target available debt, and borrowing rate.
2. Considered the input from Faraz, the Stability Scope Facilitator, who provided advisory recommendations on the proposed changes.
3. Based on the input from Faraz and the significance of the proposed changes, initiated a governance poll to gather the community's support or opposition to the adjustments.
4. Drafted a forum response indicating approval for the governance poll on adjusting the Spork Protocol D3M parameters.

### Reasoning:
The proposed changes to the Spork Protocol D3M parameters have potential implications for risk and growth. Consulting the Stability Scope Facilitator's input provided a comprehensive understanding of the proposed modifications. By initiating a governance poll, MKR token holders' sentiment can be gauged, helping guide further decision-making through an executive vote.

## Scenario B: Onboarding ABC Token to Spork Protocol

### Actions Taken:
1. Reviewed the proposal from Alice to onboard the ABC token to the Spork Protocol, along with the outlined parameters.
2. Took into account Faraz's advisory response that highlighted the alignment with previous evaluations and supportive analysis for the token's onboarding.
3. Recognizing the significance of adding a new token to the protocol, decided to propose a governance poll for the community to express support or opposition to the onboarding of the ABC token.
4. Composed a forum response expressing approval for initiating a governance poll for the onboarding of the ABC token to the Spork Protocol.

### Reasoning:
Given the complexity and potential impact of onboarding a new token to the Spork Protocol, it's essential to gather MKR token holders' sentiment through a governance poll. The supportive analysis from the Stability Scope Facilitator adds credibility to the proposal and supports its evaluation by the community.

In both scenarios, the decision to initiate governance polls aligns with MakerDAO's decentralized governance model, ensuring that important decisions are made based on the approval of MKR voters. The forum responses provide clear communication of the proposed actions to stakeholders and facilitate transparent decision-making processes.
