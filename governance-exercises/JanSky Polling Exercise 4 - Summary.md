# Summary/Interpretation 

When reading the prompt, several thoughts came to mind that informed my actions:

### Urgent Nature of the Situation:

- The urgency of the situation is clear due to the critical exploit identified by Roundtable Develop.
- Noting that both technical ecosystem actors (Roundtable Develop and WeCodeCrypto) had independently confirmed the existence of the exploit.
- Fixes are being discussed and are in development; I can assume that the technical teams find the bug needs urgent attention.
  
### Request for Emergency Poll and Governance Call:

- MIP24 (which I reviewed in the last exercise) mentions the option of initiating an emergency poll to gauge community support.
- Organizing an emergency governance call with relevant parties (Roundtable Develop, WeCodeCrypto, and Imogen) would better inform me in my response role.
- Real-time triaging will be more effective over a call than text-based chat. 

### Respect for Expertise:

- I need to respect the expertise of Imogen, the Protocol Scope Facilitator, in Executive spell work. They made the initial post and the Atlas suggests it should be their call on what ends up in spell code.
- Imogen should also be more familiar with developer tensions over this issue, as I have likely been notified far later than they would have been.

### Action Plan and Poll Duration:

- Advising that the emergency poll on Fix A will have a 12-hour duration to expedite decision-making. Difficult to nail down a time frame, but longer than 8 hours seems reasonable if we want to see how entities vote on the matter.
- Make clear that the purpose of the poll is to provide additional input. I should note that the poll will not be binding in the forum in case more information comes to light or consensus is reached in the emergency call. 
- Call organizing should take place on a familiar platform, suggesting Discord might be apt for this purpose.

### Communication Etiquette:

- Requesting participants maintain a focused and respectful discussion in the thread and avoid off-topic or inflammatory comments is important. There has already been some noted animosity in the thread between the developer teams.
- Mentioning the intention to delete irrelevant comments and redirect debates to separate threads if necessary should lighten the blow if I have to take action later.
- I need to avoid making this post about my position but also convey why I am taking the actions I suggest.
  
### Efficient Messaging and Transparency:

- Important to mention that progress updates on the Emergency Response will be posted in the same thread.
- Highlight that notes from the emergency governance call will be shared with the community.

### Conclusion

My overall approach aimed to ensure swift action while respecting the expertise of involved parties and fostering transparent communication. The focus was on addressing the immediate situation, coordinating efforts, and allowing stakeholders to influence the decision-making process.
