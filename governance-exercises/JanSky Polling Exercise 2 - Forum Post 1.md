Thank you, everyone, for your engagement in this matter. Based on a thorough review of the materials provided by Diane and by the principles outlined in the MakerDAO governance framework, I will initiate a poll to address the reasonable suspicion regarding Clive's identity. This action is not taken lightly and reflects my commitment to maintaining the integrity of the MakerDAO ecosystem.

I want to clarify that the evidence at hand has led to the conclusion that there is a real possibility that Clive's identity may have been compromised, as stated in Article 2.6.6 of the Atlas. This article mandates that, in such cases, a FacilitatorDAO should take immediate action to derecognize the Aligned Delegate to safeguard the privacy and security of the Maker Ecosystem. Since we are operating before FacilitatorDAOs exist, I -- as Governance Facilitator -- am taking the guidance in [Article 2.6.6.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-1) as direction to place a reasonable suspicion of Aligned Delegate Identity in the hands of MKR holders.

This action is not a judgment on Clive's identity, but rather a step to ensure adherence to the governance procedures and to prevent potential risks outlined by the Atlas.

Additionally, I would like to address your concerns, @Clive. Your statements in defense of mistaken identity will be linked in the formal poll for MKR holders to consider before voting. While you state there is an ethical issue with this system, I would remind you that you signed up to be an Aligned Delegate and thus consented to the rules and incentives outlined in the Atlas.

Please understand that my primary goal is to uphold the security and privacy of the MakerDAO community. If any community member presents reasonable evidence that an Aligned Delegate's identity has been compromised I must take the allegation seriously and proceed based on the text of the Atlas. Since the full checks and balances of FacilitatorDAOs are not in place at this time, it is my view that a poll of the MKR holders linking to all available claims and counterclaims is the correct way to proceed.

For more information on the Atlas's provisions, you can refer to [MIP101 Article 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy). I encourage respectful and thoughtful engagement as we navigate these situations together.
