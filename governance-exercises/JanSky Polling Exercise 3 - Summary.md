# Summary/Interpretation 

### Acknowledging the Proposal:

- I recognize Emilia's proposal was made with some urgency, the response needs to come out on Monday as they indicated they expected a poll to be posted.
- Community members will also be dealing with the drop of information before a weekend, so I should favor a direct address to slow down the process over a more lengthy examination detailing what is being proposed.

### Measured Approach and Well-Informed Decisions:

- The Atlas mentions the need for a cautious and well-informed approach to decision-making that aligns with the MakerDAO governance framework. This gives some legitimacy to delaying.
- I should respect the will of token voters (large active holders being a large share of that population), but I note this thread does not contain support from outside parties. 
 
### Review of Proposal Concerns:

I identified 3 key areas of concern within the proposed standing order change:
- Voter Understanding: Highlighting the complexity of the proposed changes and the need for voters to fully comprehend their implications.
- Adherence to Atlas and MIP104: Noting the importance of aligning with existing governance documents for legitimacy.
- ALM Framework and Structure: Highlighting the need to consider the forthcoming ALM framework update and its impact.

These terms could be confusing to a general audience so more detailed "next steps" will likely be helpful for all the ecosystem actors.

### Specific Recommendations:

- I should identify the actors responsible for taking the actions, as well as what a completed task looks like.
- I should try to keep the post brief while doing this so I do not get accused of grandstanding to cause a delay.
 
### Poll Timing and Community Consensus:

- I must emphasize the importance of gathering understanding and consensus before proceeding with a weekly poll.
- Offering MIP24 as a remedy should soften the blow of this delay and quell fears over a greater issue arising while the requested items are produced.
 
### Conclusion

While I have a bias to craft a poll during "polling exercises" I am convinced this situation was designed to not recommend a poll. It rings somewhat familiar with a lot of last-minute Endgame polling. This situation has enough concrete info suggested -- but not provided -- for me to feel comfortable denying the request. The Stability Scope was particularly unhelpful in offering clarity given the lack of information, which also suggests the need for more transparency before allowing a potentially unaligned change into the Voting Portal.
