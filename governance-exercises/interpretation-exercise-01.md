Do you think there is any ambiguity in these clauses? If so, where, and how would you rewrite the clauses to remove the ambiguity?

How would you interpret these clauses as-they-are in the following situations? Would you allow votes to take place? What would be the contents of these votes?

---

**Situation A**

Aligned Delegates are not being compensated due to a clear typo elsewhere in the Governance Scope.

**Situation B**

A large token holder wants to add logic to the Stability Scope scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle. The author claims this change is required to prevent the DAO losing significant value.

**Situation C**

An anonymous account wants to add logic to the Stability Scope scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle. The author claims this change is required to prevent the DAO losing significant value.

**Situation D**

As a consequence of a significant reduction in Aligned Delegate pay, all Aligned Delegates step down from the position.

## Response

Your resonse should include:
* Brief description of any ambiguity you can identify in these clauses.
* A rewrite of the clauses, if you feel it is required.
* For each situation:
    * A brief description of how you would interpret the relevant clauses given the situation.
    * A brief description of how you would respond as Governance Facilitator. Votes, forum posts, etc. 

Please don't draft other materials like polls or forum posts fully. I'm only looking for a summary of your response in these situations.

## JanSky Interpretation Exercise 1: Bootstrapping Governance Votes

Ambiguity and Clause Rewrites:

The clauses in the Governance Scope (12.1 - 12.1.2) provide a framework for Governance Facilitators to address unintended consequences or mistakes. However, there is a potential ambiguity regarding the threshold or criteria that can trigger the need for Governance Polls. To clarify, the following rewrite could be considered:

12.1: Bootstrapping Governance Votes
Governance Facilitators are empowered to exercise broad judgment when making direct Atlas interpretations and edits to the Atlas and the Scope Artifacts, specifically in cases where unintended consequences or mistakes in the affected documents compromise Maker Governance's correct functioning.

12.1.1: In the event of unintended consequences or mistakes in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts causing Maker Governance to malfunction, Governance Facilitators are authorized to initiate a Governance Poll for the next weekly cycle at any time, allowing MKR holders to decide on corrective actions.

12.1.2: Governance Facilitators can propose specific edits to any content within a Scope Artifact through a weekly Governance Poll.

Situation A: Typo in Compensation

Interpretation: The situation involves an error in the Governance Scope that results in Aligned Delegates not receiving their compensation as intended.

Response: As a Governance Facilitator, I would interpret this situation as falling within the scope of mistakes. I would initiate a Governance Poll on the following Monday to rectify the issue promptly and allow MKR holders to confirm the typo on compensating Aligned Delegates correctly.

Situation B: Urgent Stability Scope Change

Interpretation: A large token holder seeks to expedite a change in the Stability Scope to prevent substantial loss for the DAO, it would be up to the acting Governance Facilitators to confirm this substantial loss would be the result of `unintended consequences or mistakes in the affected documents`.

Response: In this scenario, I would likely interpret the clauses as applicable. The proposed change seems aligned with addressing unintended consequences (potential loss) and meets the criteria for initiating a Governance Poll. As a Governance Facilitator, I would facilitate the proposal through a Governance Poll, provided the issue can be wholly corrected with a small edit to the Stability Scope. This action allows MKR holders to decide on the urgency of the change.

Situation C: Urgent Stability Scope Change (Anonymous Account)

Interpretation: An anonymous account requests a swift change to the Stability Scope to prevent significant DAO value loss, it would be up to the acting Governance Facilitators to confirm this substantial loss would be the result of `unintended consequences or mistakes in the affected documents`.

Response: Similar to Situation B, I would interpret the clauses likely as applicable here. The urgency and the potential impact on DAO value align with addressing unintended consequences. As a Governance Facilitator, I would proceed with a Governance Poll, provided the issue can be wholly corrected with a small edit to the Stability Scope. This action allows MKR holders to decide on the urgency of the change.

Situation D: Aligned Delegate Pay Reduction

Interpretation: Due to a considerable reduction in Aligned Delegate pay, all Delegates resign from their positions.

Response: I would interpret this situation as a consequence of intended outcomes related to the pay reduction, unlikely to produce an urgent poll under 12.1. While the statute primarily addresses unintended consequences and mistakes, this situation might require a broader interpretation (perhaps the reduction is a typo, for instance). I would engage with the community through forum posts and discussions to assess the situation's implications and potential solutions before considering a Governance Poll.

In summary, section 12.1 empowers Governance Facilitators to address unintended consequences or mistakes, enabling timely corrections through Governance Polls. I would actively engage with the community, initiate polls when necessary, and leverage forum discussions to ensure the MakerDAO ecosystem's stability.
